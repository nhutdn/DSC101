# DSC101

## Requirements

- Have background in Mathematics (Linear Algebra, Analysis, Probability Theory)
- Have Anaconda/Spyder installed
- People with strong skills in programming, especially Python can skip amphi 1, 2, 3.

## Goal

- Get familiar with basic programming in Python
- Discover some basic problems and algorithms for supervised learning (regression, classification) and non-supervised learning (clustering, density estimation)
- Know how to implement solutions for some (pseudo-)real machine learning problem.

## Organisation

- 9 units (9 is the holly number of Ecole Polytechnique)
- 1 unit = 1 amphi (lecture) + 0 or 1 PC (exercises) + 1 TD (pratical session, working with machines)
- 1 TD is like a miniproject (200 - 500 code lines, 1/3 have already been written)
- No idea how long an unit should take, depending on the students.
- Course repository: https://github.com/riduan91/DSC101/ 
- Solutions of PC exercises and TD problems may be available, but don't study them at the first visit.
